#Phone Number Authentication with Firebase

This project implements phone number authentication using Firebase, providing a secure and reliable way to verify users. The authentication process works as follows:

  User Input: The user enters their mobile phone number into the app.

  OTP Generation: Firebase Authentication sends a One-Time Password (OTP) to the provided number. The OTP is unique, time-limited, and valid for a single authentication attempt.

  OTP Verification: The user enters the received OTP into the app. Firebase verifies the code to confirm the user's identity.
  
  Secure Access: Once the OTP is verified, the user is successfully authenticated, allowing access to app features while ensuring account security.

  Automatic Handling: Firebase handles edge cases like OTP expiration, resending codes, and automatic verification on supported devices, providing a smooth user experience.

Key Features:

  Secure Authentication: No password is required, reducing the risk of password leaks or breaches.

  Real-Time Verification: OTP is verified instantly to grant or deny access.

  Cross-Platform Support: Works on Android, iOS, and Web applications using the same Firebase backend.

  Customizable UX: Developers can design custom OTP input screens and messages while leveraging Firebaseâ€™s robust backend.
